				<h3>About - Bollywood</h3>
				<p>“Bollywood” - a tongue-in-cheek ten created by the English-language press hi India in the late 1970s - 
                    has now become the dominant global term to refer to the prolific and box-office oriented Hindi language 
                    film industry located in Bombay (renamed Mumbai in 1995). The Bombay film industry is aesthetically and 
                    culturally distinct from Hollywood, but as prolific and ubiquitous in its production and circulation of 
                    narratives and images. As the dominant media institution within India, the Bombay film Industry plays an 
                    important role in constructing and defining dichotomies like “traditional/modern” “global/local,” 
                    “Western/Eastern” and cate­gories such as “culture,” “nation,” and “Indian”.</p>
				<p>The most frequent factual error perpetuated by the international and Indian press is that the Bombay film 
                   industry produces 800--1,000 films a year. The Bombay industry actually produces about 150—200 films a year. 
                   Feature films are produced in approx­imately 20 languages in India and there are multiple film industries whose 
                   total output makes India the largest feature film-producing country in the world. The cities of Madras and Hyderabad 
                   are home to the Tamil and Telugu language film industries which are as, or more prolific than the Bombay industry in 
                   terms of the number of films made per year.</p>
                <p>However, Hindi films, though comprising approximately 20 percent of total production, are the ones that circulate nationally 
                   and internationally, dominate the discourse about Indian cinema, and are regarded as the standard or archetype to follow or oppose. 
                   Outside India, the category “popular Indian cinema” tends to denote Hindi films produced in Bombay. The distinctive features of popular 
                   Hindi cinema — song and dance, melodrama, lavish production values, emphasis upon stars and spectacle -- are common to films made in the 
                   southern Indian industries as well. Thus, “Bollywood” has become a shorthand reference not only to a specific industry, but also to a specific 
                   style of filmmaking within the Industry which is aggressively oriented toward box-office success and broad audience appeal 
                   - <strong>Tejaswini Ganti</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Note:-</strong> Cinema in India encompasses a great deal more diversity and has a longer history than the Bombay film industry. 
                    Even as a British colony, India was the third largest producer of films in the world. Therefore, with few notable exceptions, this website 
                    will not attempt to focus on “Indian cinema,” but will focus on Hindi cinema.</p>
