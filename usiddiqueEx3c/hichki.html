						A teacher can be a mentor, a guide and in rare cases, even a friend. Hichki is the story of one such teacher. What makes Naina (Rani Mukerji) different from other teachers is her Tourette Syndrome. She makes hics and click noises due to a neurological disorder that she explains with spirit and wit. She fights the odds – reactions to her own unsettling, hiccup-powered speech as well as her class of 14 scoundrels who mock her at every turn. These kids are a part of the right to education initiative, thus landing up in an elite school where most kids and teachers have a hoity air of ‘high class’. No one gives Naina a chance to succeed with her bunch of no-good students. But she perseveres. That’s the gist of the film. Its a fresh concept, especially from the perspective of people with disorders. Just because you’re not normal, that doesn’t mean you can’t fit in or you can’t succeed. That thought fuels the drama of the film. But the screenplay stops Hichki from being as great as it could have been. The film is engaging, insightful and entertaining but given the premise it had more potential.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yet, there’s so much to love and appreciate in director Siddharth P Malhotra’s film. Owing to the Tourette Syndrome, Naina’s character makes sounds like ‘waa waa’ and ‘chak chak’ at random. The placement of the ‘waa waa’ sounds in particular is most interesting. There’s a sublime level of intelligence and detail in Hichki’s direction that’s worth appreciating. The use of out-of-the-box learning tools within the school environment adds to the film. The director does a good job at crafting and presenting the film. Sadly, the screenplay doesn’t quite cut it for top grades. The first half is spent setting up the story, while the second half heightens the drama but doesn’t change too many gears. Hichki is a film full of emotions, but they just don’t hit the right arc, especially during the climactic portions.
						</p>
						<p>
							That’s not to say, that the film isn’t worthy of a recommendation. Rani Mukerji’s performance is distinction level stuff. She’s consistent with the Tourette Syndrome and she makes moments of high drama look absolutely effortless. The constant knocks on the chin are pure acting masterclass. Her performance adds the proverbial punch to this story. The casting is top notch too. Young actors who portray the unruly 9F class all do a wonderful job. Harsh Mayar as Aatish, the leader of the mischievous pack is superb. Other actors portraying students in the film are all good too. Neeraj Kabi, who plays the stern science teacher Wadia, is spectacular as well. The efforts of the cast, to a large extent, overshadow the limited writing. The music by Jasleen Royal also adds a nice spark to the proceedings. Its just the right amount of fresh and fun.
                            </p>

							Hichki had the potential to be more than just a classroom saga. It does touch upon Naina’s personal struggles and her conflicted relationship with her father. But it could’ve explored these aspects a lot more. For all its shortcomings, the movie still has plenty of freshness, insights and emotional intelligence. It can make you nostalgic about your school days and remind you of your favourite teacher. This one definitely deserves good grades.
